# Website Release System

## Overview

The MyBitcoinFuture website includes an automated release announcement and download system that integrates with GitHub releases to provide users with up-to-date information about new versions and easy access to downloads.

## Components

### 1. Releases Page (`/releases`)
- **Location**: `src/components/Releases.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Dedicated page for viewing all releases and downloading assets
- **Features**:
  - Fetches releases from GitHub API
  - Displays release notes and changelog
  - Platform-specific download links
  - File size and download count information
  - Release type badges (Release, Pre-release, Draft)

### 2. Release Announcements Component
- **Location**: `src/components/ReleaseAnnouncements.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Displays recent release announcements on the homepage
- **Features**:
  - Highlights latest release
  - Parses changelog into categorized sections
  - Shows feature additions, bug fixes, improvements, and security updates
  - Links to full release information

### 3. Version Tracking
- **Location**: `src/version.js`
- **Purpose**: Tracks current version and release information
- **Updated**: Automatically via CI/CD when new releases are created

## Integration Flow

### Dashboard Release â†’ Website Update

1. **Dashboard Release Created**:
   - GitHub release is created in `dashboard` repository
   - Release workflow triggers website update

2. **Website Update Triggered**:
   - Repository dispatch event sent to `website` repository
   - Website CI/CD workflow runs

3. **Version Information Updated**:
   - `scripts/update-version.js` updates version information
   - Changes committed and pushed

4. **Website Deployed**:
   - Updated website deployed to GitHub Pages
   - New release information available to users

## API Integration

### GitHub Releases API
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.github.com/repos/MyBitcoinFuture/dashboard/releases`
- **Rate Limit**: 60 requests/hour for unauthenticated requests
- **Data Retrieved**:
  - Release name and tag
  - Release notes and body
  - Download assets and metadata
  - Release date and status

### Changelog Parsing
The system automatically parses release notes to categorize changes:

```javascript
const changelog = parseChangelog(release.body);
// Returns:
{
  features: ['New wallet management features', 'Enhanced security'],
  fixes: ['Fixed transaction sync issue', 'Resolved UI bug'],
  improvements: ['Performance optimization', 'Better error handling'],
  security: ['Security patch for authentication']
}
```
